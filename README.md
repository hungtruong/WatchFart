#WatchFart

By [Hung Truong](http://www.hung-truong.com/)

WatchFart is (maybe) the world's first fart app for the Apple Watch, using WatchKit.

##Running WatchFart
To run WatchFart, you need to set up App Groups for the app (I had to do this so you probably will, too). This is so the iPhone app can write the fart sound file to a shared container, and the Apple Watch app can read from that shared container to play the fart sound.

Yes, it's a lot of work to just play a simple fart sound.
